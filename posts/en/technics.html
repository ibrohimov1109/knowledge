<h1>RULES, TECHNIQUES, AND METHODS OF WORK MANAGEMENT</h1>
<div class="subtitle">Productivity methods</div>

<!-- INTRO -->
<p>
The methods below are used to properly plan work, improve focus,
increase productivity, and speed up results.
They are useful both in daily life and business processes,
and when applied consistently, they lead to significant growth.
</p>

<h2>1. The 2-minute rule</h2>
<p>
If a task can be completed within 2 minutes,
do it immediately without postponing it.
This prevents small tasks from piling up.
</p>

<h2>2. The SMART technique</h2>
<p>
Goals should be clear and measurable.
SMART stands for:
• Specific
• Measurable
• Achievable
• Relevant
• Time-bound
</p>

<h2>3. Eat-the-frog technique</h2>
<p>
Complete the most difficult and unpleasant task first.
This makes the rest of the day’s tasks feel easier and lighter.
</p>

<h2>4. The DAMA method</h2>
<p>
Plan the work and move step by step.
Analyze the results at the end of each stage.
</p>

<h2>5. The Rooster story</h2>
<p>
A method explained through a story about waking up at the same time every day
and maintaining discipline and order.
It reminds that discipline is the foundation of success.
</p>

<h2>6. The 5 percent daily growth method without breaking consistency</h2>
<p>
Not a big leap, but small daily growth.
A 5 percent daily improvement brings great results in the long run.
</p>

<h2>7. The Hamburger method</h2>
<p>
When delivering information or feedback:
• start with something positive,
• then mention criticism or a problem,
• finish with another positive point.
This helps influence others without hurting them.
</p>

<h2>8. The Pomodoro method</h2>
<p>
Work with full focus on a single task for a fixed period
(for example, 25 minutes),
then take a short break.
This strengthens concentration.
</p>

<h2>9. The Pilaf method</h2>
<p>
Do each task at the right time and in the correct order.
Just like cooking pilaf follows a sequence,
order is important in work as well.
</p>

<h2>10. The Hunter method</h2>
<p>
Act with a clear goal.
Like a hunter, focus on a single target
and move forward without distractions.
