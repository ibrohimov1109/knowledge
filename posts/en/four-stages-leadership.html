<h1>4 STAGES OF LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT</h1>
<div class="subtitle">From Consultant to Mentor</div>

<p>This post explains the journey from consultant to professional mentor leader through 4 key stages. Each stage describes the situations leaders face, their inner experiences, and the tasks that must be completed.</p>

<img src="../../assets/images/fourstep_inpost1.png" alt="Stage 1" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:12px; margin:20px 0;">

<h2>Stage 1. Shyness, hesitation, adaptation, learning stage</h2>

<p>This stage includes consultants from 0% to 3%. At this stage, a leader strongly desires to take the first step toward Directorship, but when it comes to action, they cannot break mental limits, which is natural. To overcome this, a leader must start working, take the first steps, continuously learn the work, and apply it in practice. Even tasks that seem difficult or unclear should be attempted. Over time, doubts, fears, and anxiety gradually disappear, and professionalism grows day by day. A beginner leader should not immediately invite people without properly understanding the work. They must first learn correct presentations and invitations from their mentor, then begin inviting others.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<p class="task">1. Keep and maintain 5 notebooks and teach without tokens</p>
<p class="task">2. Learn and teach how to download the app without tokens</p>
<p class="task">3. Learn and teach how to register without tokens</p>
<p class="task">4. Learn and teach how to place orders without tokens</p>
<p class="task">5. Learn and teach how to choose a pickup point address without tokens</p>
<p class="task">6. Learn and teach how to receive 5-step start program gifts without tokens</p>
<p class="task">7. Enter the app daily, study at least 2 products, learn 20–25 products thoroughly, and promote them to customers</p>
<p class="task">8. Learn promotion well, apply it in practice, and inform at least 5 customers daily</p>
<p class="task">9. Thoroughly learn and teach the marketing plan</p>
<p class="task">10. Thoroughly learn and teach company opportunities without tokens</p>
<p class="task">11. Follow the rule “No lesson should pass without you”</p>
<p class="task">12. Follow the rule “Do simple work consistently”</p>
<p class="task">13. Write 100 contacts for your mentor as the first leadership step</p>

<p>If you invite people yourself at this stage, the results will be ineffective because your knowledge about the company and products is limited. Leaders in this category are considered BASIC LEADERS: they work a lot but earn little.</p>

<h2>Stage 2. Adaptation and acceptance stage</h2>

<p>Leaders from 6% to 9%. At this stage, the leader knows themselves better, adapts to the work, and begins to see results. However, doubts may arise: “Is this for me?” or “What if I fail?” These doubts disappear through consistent work and learning. Responsibility increases, mistakes are costly, and team building must be approached carefully. Treat the work as a profession and complete daily tasks on time.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<p class="task">1. Conduct presentations</p>
<p class="task">2. Communicate with contacts</p>
<p class="task">3. Create groups</p>
<p class="task">4. Distribute advertising</p>
<p class="task">5. Create plans above your current level and monitor daily</p>
<p class="task">6. Conduct Telegram voice lessons on products and business</p>
<p class="task">7. Thoroughly learn and apply the marketing plan</p>
<p class="task">8. Learn reporting</p>
<p class="task">9. Build immunity to the word “no”</p>
<p class="task">10. Gradually increase conversion results over 9 days</p>
<p class="task">11. Learn at least 50 products and explain them to customers</p>
<p class="task">12. Adopt professional habits and work consistently under a system</p>

<h2>Stage 3. Adaptation, acceptance, and ability to teach knowledge</h2>

<p>Leaders from 12% to 19%. Leaders at this stage are knowledgeable and have teams but may struggle with discouragement if progress slows. Overthinking reduces results. The key is identifying strong independent leaders and focusing on execution rather than doubt.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<p class="task">• Balance family and work (6 hours)</p>
<p class="task">• Spiritual and personal development (6 hours)</p>
<p class="task">• Initiative and communication</p>
<p class="task">• Analysis and task distribution</p>
<p class="task">• Control and supervision</p>
<p class="task">• Full adaptation to the word “no”</p>
<p class="task">• Confident video lessons</p>
<p class="task">• Follow professional standards</p>

<h2>Stage 4. The pride stage</h2>

<p>Directorship levels of 23% and above. These leaders clearly understand what to do and when. Their students copy actions, not words. Growth comes from delegation, control, and leadership vision.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<p class="task">1. Provide new ideas and motivation</p>
<p class="task">2. Organize online and offline trainings</p>
<p class="task">3. Develop independent leaders through analysis and mentoring</p>
<p class="task">4. Follow professional leadership standards</p>
