<h1>EFFECTIVE AND BLESSED DAILY PLAN</h1>
<div class="subtitle">20 Practical Rules</div>

<!-- INTRO -->
<p>The daily plan below is based on proven practical rules that deliver consistent results in network marketing. Following this plan regularly leads to business growth, leadership development, and abundance.</p>

<h2>1. Morning prayers</h2>
<p>Perform prayers in the morning — every day.</p>

<h2>2. A new idea every day</h2>
<p>Work on at least one new thought or idea per day — every day.</p>

<h2>3. Warm relationships with the team</h2>
<p>Kind words, promotion, and motivation within the team — every day.</p>

<h2>4. Communicating with contacts</h2>
<p>Communicate with new and existing contacts — every day.</p>

<h2>5. Recruiting</h2>
<p>Invite new people — twice a week.</p>

<h2>6. Home meetings</h2>
<p>Organize home-based meetings — once a week.</p>

<h2>7. Relationships with leaders</h2>
<p>Communication and conversations with leaders — five times a day.</p>

<h2>8. One-on-one talks with consultants</h2>
<p>Individual conversations with consultants in the team — twice a week.</p>

<h2>9. Master classes</h2>
<p>Live or video master classes — three times a week.</p>

<h2>10. Follow-ups</h2>
<p>Re-contact people you spoke with yesterday or those who were partially interested, and re-engage them — every day.</p>

<h2>11. Working with special groups</h2>
<p>Create separate groups for leaders who choose business-lady or travel directions.
• Share new ideas daily,
• Provide new information,
• Stay in constant communication.
Best time: evening, every day.</p>

<h2>12. Keeping a daily planner</h2>
<p>Maintain a daily planner consistently. At least 30 tasks should be completed per day — every day.</p>

<h2>13. Giving charity</h2>
<p>Based on your ability, give charity even if it is small. Making someone happy with kind words also counts as charity — every day.</p>

<h2>14. Studying the habits of billionaires</h2>
<p>Work on yourself and learn to think big — every day.</p>

<h2>15. Developing new leaders from leaders</h2>
<p>Develop new leaders through existing leaders — every day.</p>

<h2>16. Learning products</h2>
<p>Study at least one product per day — every day.</p>

<h2>17. Offline training sessions</h2>
<p>Organize offline meetings and training sessions — once per catalog.</p>

<h2>18. One-on-one meetings</h2>
<p>Individual conversations and analysis with leaders. At least 5 people per week — every day.</p>

<h2>19. Reminding goals</h2>
<p>Remind leaders of their goals. If possible — every day.</p>

<h2>20. Business meetings and recognition</h2>
<p>Hold business meetings with leaders in offices or cafes and conduct recognition events — once per catalog.</p>

<h2>Final thought</h2>

• the business operates systematically,
• the team becomes stronger,
• results and abundance appear.</p>
